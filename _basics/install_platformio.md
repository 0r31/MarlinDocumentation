Before reading this article, you should have already read [Installing Marlin](install.html) and downloaded the Marlin source code. If you haven't done these steps yet, take [one step back](install.html), then follow the link back to this page to continue the process.

## PlatformIO

PlatformIO is available as a stand alone CLI tool and as a plugin for 10+ environments. The most popular environments in the 3D printing community are:
- Microsoft's *Visual Studio Code* (aka ***VSCode***)
- ~~Github's free ***Atom*** text editor~~
- ***Sublime Text***

Install PlatformIO as a stand alone CLI or with your choice of environment using the links below:
- [PlatformIO in VSCode](install_platformio_vscode.html)
- ~~[PlatformIO in Atom](install_platformio_atom.html)~~
- [PlatformIO in Sublime](install_platformio_sublime.html)
- [PlatformIO Command-Line](install_platformio_cli.html)

## Auto Build Marlin

The Marlin package includes a *Visual Studio Code* extension that works with **PlatformIO** to make building and uploading Marlin as easy as pressing a button. See the [Auto Build Marlin](/docs/basics/auto_build_marlin.html) page for details.
