title: Linear Move
brief: Add a straight line movement to the planner

experimental: false
since: 1.0.0-beta
group: planner

codes:
  - G0
  - G1

long:
  - The effect of G1 is to simply add a move to the queue, the move itself will happen at some point in the future. All the specified axes will move simultaneously to arrive at the given coordinates at the same time using linear interpolation. The speed may change over time following an acceleration curve, according to the acceleration and jerk settings of the given axes. Marlin treats G0 (rapid linear movement) as an alias to G1 (rapid movement). Some G-Code generators may, by convention, use G0 for non-extrusion movements (those without the E axis) and G1 for moves with the extruder.

  -
    tag: E
    type: float
    unit: mm
    optional: true
    description: The amount to extrude between the starting point and ending point
  -
    tag: F
    type: float
    unit: mm/min
    optional: true
    description: The maximum movement rate of the move between the starting and ending point

examples:
  -
    pre:
      The most basic example is to set a feedrate and them move the tool on the XY position.
    code:
      - G0 X12   ; move to 12mm on the X axis
      - G0 F1500 ; set the feedrate to 1500mm/minute
      - G1 X90.6 Y13.8 ; move to 90.6mm on the X axis and 13.8mm on the Y axis

  -
    pre:
      There are some caveats related with feedrates, consider the following&#x3A;
    code:
      - G1 F1500 ; set the feedrate to 1500mm/minute
      - G1 X50 Y25.3 E22.4 ; move while extruding
    post:
      In the above example the feedrate is set to 1500mm/minute on line 1, then move the tool 50mm on the X axis and 25.3mm on the Y axis while extruding 22.4mm of filament between the two points.
  -
    code:
      - G1 F1500
      - G1 X50 Y25.3 E22.4 F3000
    post:
      However, in the above example, we set a feedrate of 1500 mm/minute on line 1, then do the move described above accelerating to a feedrate of 3000 mm/minute as it does so. The extrusion will accelerate along with the X and Y movement, so everything stays synchronized.
