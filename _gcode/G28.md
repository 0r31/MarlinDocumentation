title: Move to Origin
brief: Home one or more axes

long:
  - When the firmware receives this command, it moves all (or the supplied) axis's back to the zero endstops as quickly as it can, then backs off by a `[XYZ]_HOME_BUMP_MM` and slowly moves back to the zero endstop activation points to increase position accuracy.

  - This process is also known as "Homing".
