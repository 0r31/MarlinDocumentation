title: Temperature Auto-Report
brief: Auto-report temperatures to host periodically.

experimental: false
group: hosts

codes:
  - M155

long: It can be useful for host software to track temperatures and graph them over time. With `M155` hosts can set an interval for the firmware to report the current temperatures. This method is preferred over polling with `M105`.

notes:
  - Requires `AUTO_REPORT_TEMPERATURES` in `Configuration_adv.h`.
  - Also enable `EXTENDED_CAPABILITIES_REPORT` to notify hosts about this capability.

parameters:
  -
    tag: S
    optional: true
    description: Interval in seconds between auto-reports
    values:
      -
        tag: seconds
