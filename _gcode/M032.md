tag: m032
title: Select and Start
brief: Begin an SD print from a file.
author: thinkyhead

experimental: true
group: sdcard

codes:
  - M32

long:
  - The `M32` command exists to allow GCode to load other GCode files and run them as sub-programs.
  - For legacy reasons in `M32` uses the '`!`' character to start the filename (which must also be the last command parameter).

notes:
  - Requires [`SDSUPPORT`](/docs/configuration/configuration.html#sd-card)
  - Beta level and little-used feature. Needs more testing and use cases.

parameters:
  -
    tag: P
    optional: true
    description: Sub-Program flag
    values:
      -
        tag: flag
        type: bool
  -
    tag: S
    optional: true
    description: Starting file offset
    values:
      -
        tag: filepos
        type: int

examples:
  -
    pre: Select and start a file at offset 5022.
    code: M32 S5022 !/boats/sailboat.gco
  -
    pre: Select and start a file from within G-Code.
    code: M32 P !/models/lgbust.gco#
    post: The `#` suffix is needed when using `P` to "stop buffer pre-reading" so no commands after `M32` will go into the buffer until after it returns.
