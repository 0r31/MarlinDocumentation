title: TMC Z axis calibration
brief: Align ends of the Z axis and test torque
author: thinkyhead

experimental: false
requires: HAVE_TMC2130,TMC_Z_CALIBRATION
group: control

codes:
  - M915

long: |
  Using the given current, move the Z axis (at homing speed) to the top plus a given extra distance. _This intentionally grinds the Z steppers._

  Z is then re-homed to correct the position.

  This command serves two purposes:
  - To align the ends of the X gantry (for a Průša i3-style printer). Here's a [video demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqH41K2vq0g&t=300s).
  - To help you find the optimal current setting for your Z drivers.

notes: Requires `TMC_Z_CALIBRATION`.

parameters:
  -
    tag: S
    optional: true
    description: "Current value to use for the raise move. (Default: `CALIBRATION_CURRENT`)"
    values:
      -
        unit: mA
        type: int
  -
    tag: Z
    optional: true
    description: "Extra distance past `Z_MAX_POS` to move the Z axis. (Default: `CALIBRATION_EXTRA_HEIGHT`)"
    values:
      -
        unit: linear
        type: float

example:
  -
    pre: Set the current to 100mA and grind the steppers for 5mm.
    code:
      - G21 ; Units to mm
      - M915 S100 Z5
