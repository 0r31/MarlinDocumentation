title: Controlled Arc Move
brief: Add a arc movement to the planner

experimental: false
since: 1.0.0-beta
group: planner

codes:
  - G2
  - G3

long:
  - G2 will make the tool draw a clockwise arc, G3 will make it do a counter-clockwise arc. Arcs are drawn as perfect circular segments, with the number of degrees (hence, length) determined by the angular difference between the start point and the end point with respect to the center point, by default G2/G3 will draw arcs with 1mm segments, so arcs below that threshold are not recommended.

    tag: J
    type: float
    unit: mm
    optional: false
    description: An offset from the current Y position to use as the arc center
    values:

    description: The amount to extrude between the starting point and ending point
    values:
      -
        tag: pos
        type: float
        unit: mm
  -
    tag: F
    optional: true
    description: The maximum movement rate of the move between the starting and ending point
    values:
      -
        type: float
        optional: false
        unit: mm/min

examples:
  -
    pre:
      - Move in a clockwise arc from the current position to (125, 32) with the center offset from the current position by (10.5, 10.5).
    code:
      - G2 X125 Y32 I10.5 J10.5
  -
    pre:
      - Move in a counter-clockwise arc from the current position to (125, 32) with the center offset from the current position by (10.5, 10.5).
    code:
      - G3 X125 Y32 I10.5 J10.5
  -
    pre:
      - Move in a complete clockwise circle with the center offset from the current position by 20, 20.
    code:
      - G2 I20 J20
