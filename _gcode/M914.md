title: TMC Bump Sensitivity
brief: Set sensorless homing sensitivity
author: thinkyhead,mbuc

experimental: false
requires: SENSORLESS_HOMING
group: control

codes:
  - M914

long: Some TMC stepper drivers can detect when they bump into something that causes them to stop moving. This feature is so sensitive that it can actually take the place of traditional endstops. Use this command to set the bump sensitivity for the X, Y, and Z stepper drivers.

notes:
  - Set `SENSORLESS_HOMING` in `Configuration_adv.h` to enable this feature.
  - This works best with the `*_HOME_BUMP_MM` options set to 0.
  - `X/Y/Z_STALL_SENSITIVITY` is the default stall threshold.
  - This feature is compatible with the TMC2130 and TMC2209.
   -  Sensitivity   TMC2209   Others
   -    HIGHEST       255      -64
   -    LOWEST         0        63
  - High sensitivity may produce false positives.
  - Low sensitivity may fail to trigger.
