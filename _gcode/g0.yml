title: Linear Move
brief: Moves the tool in a straight line

experimental: false
since: 1.0.0-beta
group: movement

codes:
  - G0
  - G1

long:
  - Marlin treats G0 (rapid linear movement) as an alias to G1 (rapid movement).
  - All parameters are optional but at least one of them must be provided.

parameters:
  -
    tag: X
    type: float
    optional: true
    description: The position to move to on the X axis
  -
    tag: Y
    type: float
    optional: true
    description: The position to move to on the Y axis
  -
    tag: Z
    type: float
    optional: true
    description: The position to move to on the Z axis
  -
    tag: E
    type: float
    optional: true
    description: The amount to extrude between the starting point and ending point
  -
    tag: F
    type: float
    optional: true
    description: The feedrate per minute of the move between the starting and ending point

examples:
  -
    pre:
      The most basic example is to set a feedrate and them move the tool on the XY position.
    code:
      - G0 X12   ; move to 12mm on the X axis
      - G0 F1500 ; set the feedrate to 1500mm/minute
      - G1 X90.6 Y13.8 ; move to 90.6mm on the X axis and 13.8mm on the Y axis

  -
    pre:
      There are some caveats related with feedrates, consider the following&#x3A;
    code:
      - G1 F1500 ; set the feedrate to 1500mm/minute
      - G1 X50 Y25.3 E22.4 ; move while extruding
    post:
      In the above example the feedrate is set to 1500mm/minute on line 1, then move the tool 50mm on the X axis and 25.3mm on the Y axis while extruding 22.4mm of filament between the two points.
  -
    code:
      - G1 F1500
      - G1 X50 Y25.3 E22.4 F3000
    post:
      However, in the above example, we set a feedrate of 1500 mm/minute on line 1, then do the move described above accelerating to a feedrate of 3000 mm/minute as it does so. The extrusion will accelerate along with the X and Y movement, so everything stays synchronized.
