## The Layers of Marlin
As an entirely community-supported project, Marlin requires many levels of assistance beyond just the Marlin code itself. If you do happen to know some C++ and can help to patch bugs, typos, or just add helpful comments to the code, we welcome your expertise. See "[Contributing Code with Pull Requests](/docs/development/getting_started_pull_requests.html)" and to learn how to submit code.
