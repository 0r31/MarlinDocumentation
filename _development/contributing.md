## The Layers of Marlin
As a community-supported open source project, Marlin relies entirely on volunteers donating their time, effort, and insights to move the project forward. All the great stuff in Marlin 1.1 is due to a bright and engaged group of debaters, experimenters, and makers who screw up their sleep schedules, grind their steppers, and twerk their deltas so the rest of us don't have to.

Marlin needs many types of assistance beyond the code itself.

### Ways to contribute
- **[Submit some code!](/docs/development/getting_started_pull_requests.html)** If you know C or C++ and can help to patch bugs, fix typos, or just add helpful comments, we welcome your expertise. See "[Contributing Code with Pull Requests](/docs/development/getting_started_pull_requests.html)" to find out how to submit code.
- **Test the cutting-edge!** Marlin's "nightly" build is [`bugfix-1.1.x`](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/bugfix-1.1.x). It contains the most up-to-date code at all times. While it includes patches to the most recent release candidate (yay, fewer bugs!) it also contains the freshest and most untested code. Testing is how we discover edge cases, logical errors, typos, and setups that we failed to anticipate.
- **[Contribute Documentation](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/MarlinDocumentation), text, images, videos!** This website needs imminent and continuous improvement to properly cover Configuration, Installation, and Calibration, and we want to do it in style. We need your photos, diagrams, and YouTube videos to embed on these pages. A well-chosen image or well-produced video can have more impact than many pages of written documentation.
- **Promote Marlin!** Marlin needs evangelists, enthusiasts, fans, and everyday users to tell everyone just how awesome Marlin is. Users and vendors may be wary of installing Marlin 1.1 on their trusty old and reliable (esp. Mega2560-based) hardware. Let them know that Marlin continues to evolve!
