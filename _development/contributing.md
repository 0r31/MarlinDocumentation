## The Layers of Marlin
As an entirely community-supported open project, Marlin relies entirely on volunteers giving their time, effort, and insight to move the project forward. All the great stuff in Marlin 1.1 is due to a bright and engaged group of debaters, experimenters, and makers who screw up their sleep schedules, grind their steppers, and twerk their deltas so the rest of us don't have to.

Marlin needs many types of assistance beyond the code itself.

### Ways to contribute
- **[Submit some code!](/docs/development/getting_started_pull_requests.html)** If you know C or C++ and can help to patch bugs, fix typos, or just add helpful comments, we welcome your expertise. See "[Contributing Code with Pull Requests](/docs/development/getting_started_pull_requests.html)" to find out how to submit code.
- **Test the cutting-edge!** Marlin's "nightly" build is [`RCBugFix`](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/RCBugFix). It contains the most up-to-date code at all times. While it includes patches to the most recent release candidate (yay, fewer bugs!) it also contains the freshest and most untested code. Testing is how we discover edge cases, logical errors, and setups that we failed to anticipate.
- **Produce text, images, videos!** We need great documentation and promotion. Users may be wary of installing Marlin 1.1 on their old, reliable (esp. Mega2560-based) machines if they never hear about its benefits.
- **Produce text, images, videos!** These docs still need a lot of filling-in to cover the core trinity of Configuration, Installation, and Calibration. We've got a lot of text to write, but going forward we'll also need lots of photos, diagrams, and YouTube videos to embed on these pages.
- **Promote Marlin!** We need great documentation and promotion. Users may be wary of installing Marlin 1.1 on their old, reliable (esp. Mega2560-based) machines if they never hear about its benefits.
